## Install

On the root of your project run:

```
npx poetic
```

> Trying out Poetic is safe! You can review all the changes in Git before committing. If you don't like it, just discard it.

## Features

- Installs and configures **ESLint**, **Prettier** and **EditorConfig**
- Provides a curated set of rules based on **Airbnb** and **ESLint Recommended**
- **Customizable project configurations** that are shareable
- Easy to maintain with a **single dependency**
- Configures **Visual Studio Code**

## Requirements

- Yarn (There are some [limitations with NPM](https://github.com/arianacosta/poetic/issues/28) that make it incompatible with ESLint as a subdependency)

### Motivation

Keeping the code clean and organized is important to prevent bugs and to collaborate with others. Linters help identify possible errors and bad practices and formatters allow us to concentrate on the features without having to worry about the code format. Unfortunately, configuring and maintaining these tools is cumbersome and more often than not, the project ends up with incorrect configurations (if any at all).

> The goal of Poetic is to simplify the setup and maintenance of code styling tools and rules while allowing full customization. 

## Supported File Types

- Javascript (`.js`)
- TypeScript (`.ts`)
- React (`.jsx`,`.tsx`)

```
your-app/
├── package.json
└── src/
    └── [your source files]
```

> Poetic checks the code inside the `src/` directory by default. This can be changed in the `package.json`

## Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions

Poetic comes preconfigured to work with VSC, so that you can see the error indicators in real-time as well as automatic formatting on save. In order for these features to work, you need to install the following extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

## Running on the CLI

Poetic provides a few handy NPM scripts that are useful for applying the code style from the command line:

- `yarn code:clean` (Lints and formats)
- `yarn code:lint` (Lint only)
- `yarn code:format` (Format only)

> You may use these in conjunction with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to clean the code automatically before committing or pushing.

## Customizing for your project

Poetic provides a base configuration that can be easily extended or overridden. It uses the native configurations you are familiar with, so that you can build your own rules on top of it. Feel free to edit the following files as you see fit:

- ESLint: 
  - `.eslintrc.js` (Linting rules)
  - `.eslintignore` (Ignored files)
- Prettier:
  - `.prettierrc` (Formatting rules)
- TypeScript:
  - `tsconfig.json` (TS compilation)
- EditorConfig:
  - `.editorconfig` (Basic editor config)
- Visual Studio Code:
  - `.vscode/settings.json` (IDE behavior)


## Installing on a preconfigured project 

If you want to re-install poetic and wish to keep your existing rules, you can pass '--keeprules=true' to poetic init command.

```
npx poetic --keeprules=true
```
Else poetic will overwrite existing rules
